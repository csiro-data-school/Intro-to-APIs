## Swagger Specification and User Interface
Swagger Specification is a document that describes the entire API, including endpoints, request parameters, response formats, authentication methods, and other metadata. Users can explore and test API endpoints directly through the Swagger User Interface.

# NCBI 
 Let's try interacting with the NCBI Datasets here [ncbi].

The NCBI Datasets OpenAPI 3.0 spec is available in YAML format, and can be utilized by a variety of open-source tools and other software frameworks to generate client code for interacting with the REST API in a way that is idiomatic for the target language or environment.



>## Download FASTA File for a Specific Genome Accession
> Use the NCBI Datasets API to download a FASTA file for the human genome. 
> - Save the file with the name `genome`
>>## Solution
>>endpoint = genome/accession/{accessions}/download
>>set accessions = GCF_000001405.40
>>filename = genome
>{: .solution}
{: .challenge}
